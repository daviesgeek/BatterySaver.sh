BatterySaver.sh
===============

A simple script to remind you to unplug your Mac laptop when it is charged.

###Still in progress. This isn't ready to use yet, but feel free to test it out if you want.

===============

Here's the end goal.
This script will notify you (and bug you) when your laptop reaches 100% charge. Then when your battery reaches 40%, it will remind you to plug it back in. This way your laptop's battery won't be killed by leaving it plugged in 24/7.
